Blademastery is the deceptively complex art of using moderately-sized arms to dispatch enemies at a rather close distance.
There are two pillars to the use of these weapons; flexibility, and succession.

Whereas Short Arms and Long Arms both rely on Low and High levels of Momentum to achieve optimal use, Medium-length blades can capitalize on any level of Momentum, albeit with differing effects. And while Short Arms and Long Arms have precise and sweeping attacks, Medium-length blades rely on successive attacks in order to deal damage. Called "combos", consecutive attacks during the interruptions after each attack can allow chaining to occur.

Keep in mind, that with rare exception, comboing inherently results in a steady increase in momentum.
